School Assignment
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks Involved.......

You are required to show your understanding of testing approaches by using tools related to testing. 
Use an online repository to keep version control of your implementation of the Traderâ€™s Marketplace.
Be sure to submit frequent commits and pushes to the repository to keep track of the development through the chosen online repository. 
You need to post at least 1 commit and push each week during the duration of the assignment. 
'You need at least 10 commits and pushes in total.'

###Implement at least 3 out of the following 5 features:
1. Role-Based Access Control;
2. Creation of Seller and Buyer accounts;
3. Product Management;
4. Online shopping and Payment; and
5. Delivery Management.

'
The chosen features need to be implemented thoroughly: remember that it is possible that other units may opt to allow you to re-use this implementation! Each feature needs to include a proper interface for the Creation, Reading, Updating and Deletion of the entities involved. You also need to be able to List the entities involved. 
'
Take screenshots of the interface for at least one entity from within each of the above functionalities showing the Creation, Reading, Updating, Deletion and Listing (CRUDL) for that entity. For clarity: you need to have a screenshot for each item from the CRUDL for at least 3 entities, one from each of the above functions.

Add a test project and create unit test stubs for each item from the 'CRUDL' for one entity.

Take a screenshot of the commit graph after your final commit.
